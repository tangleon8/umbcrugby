      <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to UMBC Rugby Alumni</h2>
      <p>
It all started in November 1992 with the playing of the very first UMBC Alumni Game. It was cold that day, it snowed during the game and yes the field slanted uphill both ways. The next was held in 1994 and starting in 1996 it became a fixture in the spring calendar of UMBC.  In the past guys would bring a few cold ones to enjoy post game, then a few snack foods were brought,  someone brought a bucket of fried chicken and finally somewhere in 1998-1999 things started to get more formalized. Fast forward a decade plus and what started as a Saturday afternoon has become a weekend event that includes a Hall of Fame induction, presentation of the Haud Colluni Scholarship, a fantastic post game BBQ, the Best Damn Awards in all of Rugby and the presentation of the Alumni Cup.
